#Wireless Sensor Networks

The goal of this project is to generate Random nodes for WSNs using Different Distributions and generating Smallest Vector and Coloring problem for backbone network.

## Getting Started

The very first step to get this system setup on your local machine would be to use the following Git command to clone the repository on your local disk. 

    git clone https://github.com/ak229/WNS-Algo.git

Alternatively, you can also download the .zip file onto your local disk and extract the files in one location. The **production** branch will contain the code that is ready for deployment. 

Once the code is downloaded you may need to check the requirements given below and update your system accordingly. 

### Prerequisites
This program has the following software requirements: 

* Windows/ Linux
	* Python 2.7.x
	* PyPi 8.x
	* Numpy Library
	* MatplotLib
	* Math Library
	* NetworkX
	* SciPy

Once python 2.7 or higher has been installed, the next step would be to get **Numpy**, **NetworkX** and **Matplotlib**. 

In order to install Numpy, you can simply run the following command in Windows: 

    pip install numpy

In case you do not have pip installed in your machine, you can use the steps provided in the following link:

    http://scipy.org/install.html

The above link provides downloads for all the different OSes and the corresponding steps to install them as well. 

Once Numpy has been installed, we can go ahead and install matplotlib. In order to do that, use the following command:

    pip install matplotlib

Again, if you do not have **pip** installed, you can get the package from the following link. 

    http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html

Once Matplotlib has been installed, we can go ahead and install NetworkX. In order to do that, use the following command:

    pip install networkx

Download SciPy and NumPy using whl

	http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/dp2ng7en/scipy-0.18.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
	http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/dp2ng7en/numpy-1.11.2+mkl-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl

Install the above whls

	pip install scipy-0.18.1-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl
	pip install numpy-1.11.2+mkl-cp27-cp27m-win_amd64.whl




### Status

	Completed requirements for Project Part 1. Need to improve code to get +15 pts for Linear Algorithms

### Final Points

To be Continued..
