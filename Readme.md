#Wireless Sensor Networks

The goal of this project is to generate Random nodes for WSNs using Different Distributions and generating Smallest Vector and Coloring problem for backbone network.
----------

## Getting Started

The very first step to get this system setup on your local machine would be to use the following Git command to clone the repository on your local disk. 

    git clone https://github.com/ak229/WNS-Algo.git

Alternatively, you can also download the .zip file onto your local disk and extract the files in one location. The **production** branch will contain the code that is ready for deployment. 

Once the code is downloaded you may need to check the requirements given below and update your system accordingly. 

### Prerequisites
This program has the following software requirements: 

* Windows/ Linux
	* Python 2.7.x
	* PyPi 8.x
	* Numpy Library
	* MatplotLib
	* Math Library
	* NetworkX

### Status
Generated Pseudo Random Number Generators reading the input from benchmark file
